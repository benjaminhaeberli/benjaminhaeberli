# Welcome 👀

### I'm a freelance ``software developer`` based in Switzerland (CH). I have been working for more than 4 years on back-end and front-end projects and I am now focusing on _three pillars_ that are important to me: ``performance``, ``ethics`` and ``ecology`` 🌱 

## Skills 👋

I almost exclusively use open source tools and am [affiliated with the hosting company Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/goto/fr/home?utm_term=62dbdda8347a1), known for its many [ethical](https://news.infomaniak.com/en/why-choose-infomaniak/) and [ecological](https://www.infomaniak.com/en/ecology) commitments. Having found more reliable alternatives, I no longer recommend some popular tools (_WordPress, WooCommerce, jQuery, GULP, Bootstrap, etc._) but can still use them if asked.
